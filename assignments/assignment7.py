# Q1: Create a Food class with a “name” and a “kind” attribute as well as a “describe() ” method (which prints “name” and “kind” in a sentence).

# Q2: Try turning describe()  from an instance method into a class and a static method. Change it back to an instance method thereafter.

# Q3: Create a  “Meat” and a “Fruit” class – both should inherit from “Food”. Add a “cook() ” method to “Meat” and “clean() ” to “Fruit”.

# Q4: Overwrite a “dunder” method to be able to print your “Food” class.
