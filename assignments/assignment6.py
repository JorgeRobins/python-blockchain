# Q1: Write a short Python script which queries the user for input (infinite loop with exit possibility) and writes the input to a file.

# Q2: Add another option to your user interface: The user should be able to output the data stored in the file in the terminal.

# Q3: Store user input in a list (instead of directly adding it to the file) and write that list to the file – both with pickle and json.

# Q4: Adjust the logic to load the file content to work with pickled/ json data.
